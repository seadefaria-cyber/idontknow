## CONCEPT

Amanda Bynes doesn't owe anyone a comeback. She's already here.

"Girlfriend" is a reclamation video. No nostalgia bait, no "where have you been" narrative. Amanda at 40 — present tense, full volume. The visual language borrows from the Concrete Boys' *Millionaire* video (directed by ASAP & Boy Dilla): dark environments, luxury details shot on real locations, warm and cool light playing off each other, no effects budget needed because the subject carries it.

Layer in the aesthetic DNA of Charli XCX's *brat* era (raw, unapologetic, rave-adjacent), The Hellp's electroclash nocturnal energy, 2hollis' Rick Owens goth-glamour, and Fakemink's "luxury and dirty" digital nostalgia — and you get something that feels like **Amanda's world now**, not a memory of what it was.

**One line:** A woman alone in a city at night, moving through spaces that belong to her, looking like she bought the building and might burn it down.

## VISUAL TONE

| Element | Reference |
|---|---|
| **Color palette** | Deep blacks, selective warm amber, neon spill (green/pink), cold blue for contrast moments |
| **Camera** | Handheld, intimate. Close-ups on face/hands/details. Wide shots only for architecture. Think iPhone Pro + gimbal, not Steadicam |
| **Grade** | Crushed blacks, slightly lifted highlights. Warm skin tones against cool environments. Valencia-era Instagram grain on select cuts |
| **Wardrobe** | One look: leather or vinyl, oversized sunglasses, boots. Not trying — arrived. The Hellp meets Charli's "360" energy |
| **Lighting** | Practical lights only — neon signs, phone screens, street lamps, car headlights. No studio rigs |

## STRUCTURE

The video follows Amanda through **one night**, three locations, building intensity with the track's EDM/dubstep escalation.

### ACT 1 — THE QUIET (0:00–1:00)
*Before the drop. Tension.*

**Location:** Apartment interior (real apartment, low light)

Amanda alone. Getting ready — but not in a montage way. In a **ritualistic** way. Camera catches fragments: hands pulling on boots, fingers dragging eyeliner, a phone screen glowing with notifications she ignores.

- Slow, deliberate movements. She's not in a hurry.
- Warm amber light from a single lamp. Everything else is shadow.
- **Key shot:** Mirror reflection — Amanda looks at herself, doesn't smile. Holds the gaze. This is the moment the audience understands: she's not performing vulnerability. She's just not afraid.
- Reference: The feast scenes in *Millionaire* — intimate, warm, close on details.

### ACT 2 — THE WALK (1:00–2:15)
*The beat builds. The city opens up.*

**Location:** NYC streets at night (downtown, anywhere with neon + concrete)

Amanda walks. Alone. Not lost — *claiming space*.

- Wide-angle shots of her small against buildings, then cutting to tight close-ups of her face lit by passing storefronts.
- Handheld follows her from behind, then spins around to face her. She doesn't acknowledge the camera until she does — and when she does, it's a look that says *"you're still here?"*
- **Intercut:** Quick flash-cuts of her hands — touching a wall, pushing through a door, holding a lighter flame up to nothing.
- **Key shot:** Amanda crosses an empty street, headlights from a parked car backlighting her silhouette. She stops in the middle. Holds. The bass drops.
- Reference: *Millionaire*'s rooftop/urban exterior shots — real concrete, real sky, no set design needed.

### ACT 3 — THE DROP (2:15–3:30)
*Full dubstep energy. Release.*

**Location:** Underground space — parking garage, tunnel, or basement club (anywhere with echo and concrete)

This is where the brat/Hellp/2hollis energy goes maximum. The space is dark except for:
- One or two colored LED practicals (cheap, portable — crew can carry them)
- Phone flashlights held by 2-3 friends/extras in the background

Amanda moves with the bass. Not choreography — **physicality**. Hands in her hair. Spinning. Leaning against a concrete pillar. The camera is as chaotic as she is now — fast pans, rack focuses, a few frames of intentional blur.

- **Intercut:** Rapid cuts back to Acts 1 and 2 — but now those calm moments feel like they were always building to this.
- **Key shot:** Amanda facing camera, slightly out of breath, backlit by a single green or pink LED. She mouths the hook. Cuts to black mid-word.

### OUTRO (3:30–end)
*Silence after the storm.*

Quick cut back to the apartment. The lamp is still on. Amanda's boots are by the door. She's gone — or she never left. Hold on the empty room for 3 seconds. Title card:

> **GIRLFRIEND**
> Amanda Bynes

White text on black. No logo. No socials. Clean.

## WHY THIS WORKS FOR AMANDA

This isn't a comeback video. Comeback videos are apologies dressed up as celebrations. This is a **presence** video.

The references — Charli, 2hollis, The Hellp, Fakemink — aren't random. They represent a specific cultural moment: artists who reject polish, who treat chaos as an aesthetic choice, who make "not trying" look harder than anything overproduced. Amanda at 40 fits this world perfectly. She's lived more than any of these artists. The rawness isn't a costume for her — it's earned.

The Concrete Boys' *Millionaire* visual approach proves you don't need money to look expensive. You need confidence, real locations, and a camera operator who knows where to stand. That's what this treatment delivers.

**Amanda doesn't need to explain herself. She just needs to show up. The video does the rest.**
