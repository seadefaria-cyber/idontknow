# DeFaria LLC - Business Setup

## Two Separate Businesses

Sean has two businesses that must remain legally separate:

### 1. Hamptons New York LLC
- **What:** Sunglasses brand
- **Ownership:** Sean 51% / Business partner 49%
- **Status:** Needs its own LLC and Operating Agreement (not yet started)

### 2. DeFaria LLC
- **What:** Creative agency - content production for artists and brands
- **Services:** Short-form video editing (clipping), post-production, livestream production, music scoring
- **Ownership:** Sean 100% (sole member)
- **Domain:** defaria.nyc (purchased)
- **Status:** LLC filed through ZenBusiness (Starter plan), processing 7-10 days

## Why Two Separate Entities
- Protects Sean from personal liability
- Prevents partner from claiming rights to agency income
- Prevents agency liabilities from affecting sunglasses business
- Key rule: NEVER commingle funds, contracts, or operations between the two

## What's Been Done

- [x] Decided on name: DeFaria (just "DeFaria" publicly, "DeFaria LLC" legally)
- [x] Purchased domain: defaria.nyc
- [x] Filed LLC through ZenBusiness (Starter plan, $0 + $205 NY state fees)
- [x] Added registered agent service ($199/yr through ZenBusiness) - needed because Sean moves frequently
- [x] Business purpose filed: "A creative agency specializing in content production for artists and brands. Services include short-form video editing, post-production, livestream production, and music scoring."
- [x] Company indicator: LLC

## What's Next (waiting on LLC approval, 7-10 days)

- [ ] Set up Google Workspace on defaria.nyc → get sean@defaria.nyc email (~$7/mo)
- [ ] Get EIN from irs.gov (free, 10 minutes, do this after Articles of Organization arrive)
- [ ] Open business bank account (Chase, Mercury, or Relay) — need Articles of Organization + EIN + ID
- [ ] Write a simple Operating Agreement (single member, 100% Sean)
- [ ] Put up landing page on defaria.nyc (simple: name, one-liner, contact email)
- [ ] Handle NY publication requirement (ZenBusiness may handle, otherwise use NYCreations.com)

## Branding Decisions

- Public name: **DeFaria** (no "agency", "creative", or "group" suffix)
- Use "we" not "I" in all public-facing communication
- No pricing on website
- Clean logo: just the word "DeFaria" in a sharp sans-serif typeface
- Keep everything minimal — less decoration = more premium feel

## Keeping the Businesses Separate (Critical)

1. Separate bank accounts — never mix money
2. Separate contracts — each business signs its own deals
3. Separate EINs (tax IDs)
4. No cross-billing without a real contract at fair market rates
5. If one business hires the other, use a formal contract with paper trail

## Costs Summary

| Item | Cost | Frequency |
|------|------|-----------|
| ZenBusiness Starter (LLC filing) | $0 | One-time |
| NY state filing fee | $205 | One-time |
| Registered agent (ZenBusiness) | $199 | Per year |
| NY publication requirement | $200-1,000+ | One-time |
| Google Workspace | ~$7 | Per month |
| defaria.nyc domain | ~$20-35 | Per year |
| EIN | Free | One-time |

## Filed In

- **State:** New York
- **Why NY over CA:** No $800/yr franchise tax (California charges this). NY has a one-time publication cost but is cheaper long-term.
- **Registered agent address used** (not personal address) since Sean moves frequently

## Important Reminders

- Do NOT send invoices or sign contracts as DeFaria until LLC is approved
- Get an attorney to review the Operating Agreement for Hamptons New York (the 51/49 split) — this is the most important legal document
- The Hamptons New York LLC setup has NOT been started yet — that's a separate process
