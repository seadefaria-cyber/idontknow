# TikTok Comment Like Boosting

## Context

The agency needs a way to force comments to the top of TikTok comment sections on viral rap fan page videos. The comment acts as advertising — pure visibility play, not about driving profile clicks.

## Confirmed Working Provider

**Followeran** — tested 2026-02-17, likes fully delivered by 2026-02-18.

- **URL:** https://followeran.com/en/tiktok-smm-panel/
- **Service:** TikTok Comment Likes [Cheap]
- **Price:** $0.30 per 1,000 likes ($2.98 for 10K)
- **Min order:** 10 likes
- **Max order:** 10,000 likes
- **Test account:** nettspend.clips0

## Backup Providers (Not Yet Tested)

| Provider | Price/1K | URL | Notes |
|----------|---------|-----|-------|
| GetAFollower | $9.00 | https://www.getafollower.com/buy-tiktok-comment-likes.php | Premium — 60-day refill guarantee, drip-feed |
| MediaMister | ~$2-5 | https://www.mediamister.com/buy-tiktok-likes | Select "Comment Likes" type |
| JustAnotherPanel | Unknown | https://justanotherpanel.com/ | Sign up to see catalog — likely has wholesale pricing |

## Key Research Finding

TikTok comment likes are one of the hardest SMM services to find reliably. The BlackHatWorld community confirms ~90% of panels don't deliver on this specific service. Followeran is one of the few that works at wholesale pricing. GetAFollower is the most reliable premium option with guarantees.

## Strategy: Hybrid (Cheap SMM Panel + Timing)

1. Monitor 5-10 target rap fan pages for new posts
2. Comment within first 10 minutes of video going up (timing is critical)
3. Order 10K comment likes via Followeran (~$3)
4. Scale up if video is going viral
5. Using nettspend.clips0 for commenting (no separate accounts needed)

## Key Details

- **Confirmed provider:** Followeran at $0.30/1K likes
- **Cost for 10K likes:** ~$3
- **Budget at daily use:** ~$90/month (1 comment/day at 10K likes)
- **Delivery:** Confirmed — likes came in by next day (2026-02-18)
- **Drop rate:** TBD — check 72-hour retention (check by 2026-02-20)
- **Account:** Using existing nettspend.clips0 (not creating new accounts)

## Cost Comparison

| Scale | Daily likes | Cost/day | Monthly cost |
|-------|------------|----------|-------------|
| Light (1 comment/day, 10K likes) | 10,000 | ~$3 | ~$90 |
| Standard (2 comments/day, 10K each) | 20,000 | ~$6 | ~$180 |
| Heavy burst (3-5 comments on big days) | 30-50K | ~$9-15 | ~$270-450 |
