# "GIRLFRIEND" — Amanda Bynes

**Director:** Sean DeFaria
**DP:** I'm working on it.
**Track:** "Girlfriend" (EDM/Dubstep, 1 min 40 sec — waiting on another feature to be on it)
**Shoot:** Late April — May 2026
**Budget:** ~$3,500 - $5,500
**Production:** DeFaria NYC


## Treatment

Opens in a dark room. Pitch black. A single LED tube at Amanda's eye level — just her eyes, lit by a thin strip of colored light. Haze catches it and blooms outward. Lights fade up behind her one by one. Her silhouette, then the girls behind her. Full lights hit on the drop.

Two worlds.

**Love World** — golden hour beach. Amanda with her boyfriend, driving PCH in a red convertible. Warm, natural, dreamy.

**Crazy World** — the club and the streets at night. Think a crazy German club — girls with hair in their face dancing everywhere, all centered on Amanda. Strobes synced to the beat, haze filling the room. Everything shot at 60 or 120fps so it all plays back slowed down and beautiful. Amanda's in the middle of this chaos looking right at camera. There's a moment where she's fighting through a wall of hands and bodies — breaks free when the bass hits.

The hardest part of the video is cutting between the club strobes and the paparazzi on Hollywood Blvd. Inside the club the lights are controlled, pulsing to the music. On the boulevard the flashes are coming from everywhere — phones, cameras — and every flash streaks across the anamorphic lens. Back and forth between the two should feel relentless.

We also shoot extreme close-ups with a probe lens — inches from Amanda's face. Her eye with the club lights reflecting in it. Skin, texture, eyelashes. Those cut between the wide chaos and ground the whole video on her.

Fireworks on the beach at night. Sparklers, Roman candles, sparks falling in slow motion. Wet pavement reflecting every light source.

Ends calm. Amanda back with her boyfriend. Black.

**Shot on Sony FX6, anamorphic lens, 60/120fps. Probe lens for extreme close-ups. Drone for PCH.**

## Post

I'm editing. Need a colorist.

Map the song structure, match every section to shots, rough cut for structure, fine cut to the beat. Export full video + vertical cuts for TikTok/Reels/Shorts.

Note: we might do a pink/lavender color grade for the Love World scenes depending on how the footage looks.
