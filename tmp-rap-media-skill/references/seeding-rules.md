# Seeding Rules & Operational Security

## Seeding Schedule

### Phase 1: Build Credibility (Days 1-30)
- **0% Netspend content**
- 100% general rap content
- Focus: grow followers, build authentic engagement, establish the page's voice
- Each account should aim for 500+ followers before seeding begins

### Phase 2: Light Seeding (Days 31-60)
- **10% Netspend content** (1 in every 10 posts)
- 90% general rap content
- Netspend content should feel like natural discovery, not promotion
- Space Netspend posts at least 3 days apart on each account
- Never post Netspend on the same day across multiple accounts

### Phase 3: Standard Seeding (Day 61+)
- **20% Netspend content MAX** (1 in every 5 posts)
- 80% general rap content
- NEVER exceed 20% on any single account
- Continue spacing Netspend posts across accounts

## Operational Security Checklist

### Account Creation
- [ ] Each account created on a different device or with different IP
- [ ] Different email addresses for each account
- [ ] Different profile photos, bios, and display names
- [ ] No shared phone numbers
- [ ] Accounts created on different days if possible

### Ongoing Operations
- [ ] No accounts follow each other
- [ ] Different posting schedules (staggered by 2+ hours)
- [ ] Different hashtag sets per archetype
- [ ] Different caption styles per archetype
- [ ] No cross-promotion between accounts
- [ ] Never mention the same Netspend content on the same day
- [ ] Vary language when discussing Netspend across accounts

### Language Variation for Netspend Content

**Discovery language (rotate these):**
- "just found", "stumbled on", "discovered"
- "came across", "heard for the first time"
- "someone put me on to", "random playlist find"
- "3am SoundCloud dive", "algorithm blessed me"

**Praise language (rotate these):**
- "this is insane", "genuinely can't stop listening"
- "this goes crazy", "way too slept on"
- "deserves more attention", "about to blow up"
- "this is different", "something special"

**NEVER use:**
- "go stream", "go support", "check out"
- "link in bio" (for Netspend content specifically)
- Same exact phrasing on multiple accounts
- Promotional or marketing language of any kind

## Failure Thresholds

### Account Health
- If an account gets shadowbanned: pause posting for 48 hours, return to normal human scrolling behavior
- If an account gets flagged: stop all automated posting, manual-only for 1 week
- If engagement drops 50%+ suddenly: check for shadowban, reduce posting frequency

### Seeding Limits
- If a Netspend post gets significantly less engagement than average: dial back to lighter seeding
- If comments mention "paid promotion" or "ad": immediately stop seeding on that account for 2 weeks
- If multiple accounts get connected by users: consider retiring one account and creating a new one

## Content Calendar Template

### Weekly Schedule per Account (3 posts/day)

| Day | Post 1 | Post 2 | Post 3 |
|-----|--------|--------|--------|
| Mon | General | General | General |
| Tue | General | General | General |
| Wed | General | General | General* |
| Thu | General | General | General |
| Fri | General | General | General |
| Sat | General | General | General |
| Sun | General | General | General |

*After day 30, replace one "General" every ~3 days with a Netspend post on a rotating basis across accounts. Never on the same day for multiple accounts.
