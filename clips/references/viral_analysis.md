## What Types of Nettspend Content Gets the Most Views

### Tier 1: Millions of views (1M+)
- **Reaction clips from big creators** - The single most-viewed Nettspend-related content (4.6M) is a Fantano/TheNeedleDrop reaction clip, just 11 seconds long. Third-party validation from established music critics drives massive engagement.
- **Official music videos with high production value** - F*CK SWAG (3.98M) features cinematic rain shots, moody dark blue/teal lighting, and Nettspend's signature wet-hair-over-face aesthetic. This is the flagship visual identity.
- **Collaborations with scene peers** - The OsamaSon collab "withdrawals" (2.7M) and xaviersobased collab "impact" (2.55M) both hit multi-million views. Collabs within the underground/plugg scene cross-pollinate fanbases effectively.
- **Raw, unpolished short clips** - "We not like you" (1.72M) is a short-form selfie-style clip, vertical format, just Nettspend being himself. Low production, high authenticity.

### Tier 2: High performance (250K-800K)
- **Visually experimental music videos** - HOPSCOTCH (774K) and DrankDrankDrank (724K) lean into dark, glitchy, distorted aesthetics. DrankDrankDrank features heavy text overlays with the song title repeated in red, grunge textures, and a horror-adjacent vibe.
- **Live festival performances** - Rolling Loud Cali 2025 full set hit 524K. The crowd energy (phones up, massive stage production with LED screens) creates shareable moments.
- **Music videos from specific directors** - "U GON FALL" shot by @6ixvcr (300K) and "Gen 5" (264K) show that director/videographer credit matters in this scene. 6ixvcr is a known quantity.

## Visual Aesthetic Patterns

Based on the preview frames across all 10 clips:

1. **Dark, moody color grading is dominant** - Nearly every clip uses dark blues, teals, blacks, and desaturated tones. High contrast. Very little bright or warm color.
2. **Rain/water motif** - F*CK SWAG and HOPSCOTCH both feature wet hair, rain, and water as a recurring visual element. This is core to Nettspend's brand.
3. **Face obscured by hair** - Multiple clips show Nettspend with blonde/light hair covering his face. This is a signature visual motif.
4. **Grunge/distorted typography** - DrankDrankDrank uses bold red distorted text overlaid on glitchy backgrounds. Text-as-visual-art, not just subtitles.
5. **Low-angle shots and unconventional framing** - Gen 5 uses a low-angle outdoor shot. Many clips avoid standard eye-level framing.
6. **Black and white or desaturated** - "impact" features a dark nighttime cityscape in near-monochrome. Several videos use B&W or very muted palettes.
7. **Grimy, lived-in locations** - The "withdrawals" video features a bare mattress in a trashed room with "LOSER" spray-painted on the wall. Raw, anti-glamour settings.

## Common Caption/Title Styles on Viral Clips

- **Minimal, lowercase, no punctuation** - "We not like you", "impact", "withdrawals" - the most viral titles are short and understated
- **ALL CAPS for energy** - "HOPSCOTCH", "F*CK SWAG", "DRANKDRANKDRANK" - when caps are used, it is aggressive and punchy
- **One-word or two-word titles** preferred over long descriptions
- **No emoji in titles** for official content (unlike fan/reaction content which uses emoji heavily)
- **Hashtag-style formatting** in fan content: #viral #nettspend #osamason #newmusic
- **Reaction videos use provocative hooks** - "The nastiest 4 seconds of music ever" - designed to make you click immediately

## Patterns: What Goes Viral vs What Doesn't

### What WORKS:
- **Short duration (under 90 seconds)** - The biggest non-MV hit is the 11-second Fantano clip at 4.6M. "We not like you" at 65 seconds has 1.72M. Shorter = more replays = more algorithmic push.
- **Collaborations with scene artists** - OsamaSon and xaviersobased collabs both cleared 2M+. Cross-pollination is essential.
- **Third-party reaction/co-sign content** - Fantano clip (4.6M), Plaqueboymax reaction (29K), various first-reaction videos. Other creators reacting to Nettspend generates significant views.
- **Live performance energy** - Rolling Loud full set (524K), Beach Please performances (5-8K each), OsamaSon bringing out Nettspend on tour (20K). Festival/live moments create viral clips.
- **Strong visual identity** - Rain, wet hair, dark grading, face obscured. Every high-performing video has a distinct, recognizable look.
- **Raw/authentic short clips** - Phone-quality selfie videos and IG live snippets generate genuine engagement.

### What DOESN'T work as well:
- **Type beats and instrumentals** - Dozens of "Nettspend type beat" videos exist but rarely break 200 views
- **Long-form analysis without hook** - Essay-style content underperforms unless there is a provocative title
- **Fan edits without original angle** - Generic aesthetic edits get under 200 views
- **Covers/remixes by unknown artists** - These consistently underperform
- **Content without Nettspend himself** - Instrumental recreations, tutorials, etc. do not carry the same weight

## Key Takeaways for Content Repurposing

1. **The most clippable moments are SHORT** - 10-60 seconds. Extract the most intense 15-30 seconds of any longer video.
2. **The rain/wet-hair aesthetic is his brand** - Any content that reinforces this visual identity performs better.
3. **Collabs multiply reach** - Always tag and reference collaborators. OsamaSon and xaviersobased are the highest-value connections.
4. **Reaction content is massive** - If you can get established music YouTubers/TikTokers to react, that single clip can outperform the original.
5. **Live performance clips are underexploited** - Rolling Loud hit 524K as a full set. Individual 15-30 second highlight clips from these performances could each do big numbers.
6. **The underground/plugg community shares aggressively** - Content that feels like "insider" knowledge (unreleased snippets, rare live moments) gets passed around.
7. **Dark, moody, and visually distinctive beats clean/bright every time** - Do not try to make Nettspend content look polished or mainstream. The raw, dark, anti-glamour aesthetic IS the appeal.
