# Project: idontknow

## Repository Setup

This project uses **git worktrees** for parallel development across multiple terminals:

- `/Users/seandefaria/idontknow` - Main repo (branch: `main`)
- `/Users/seandefaria/idontknow-1` - Worktree 1 (branch: `wt-1`)
- `/Users/seandefaria/idontknow-2` - Worktree 2 (branch: `wt-2`)
- `/Users/seandefaria/idontknow-3` - Worktree 3 (branch: `wt-3`)
- `/Users/seandefaria/idontknow-4` - Worktree 4 (branch: `wt-4`)

## Git Workflow

- The user is NOT experienced with git. Never assume git knowledge.
- Use `/save` to save work from any worktree and merge it into main.
- Always explain what git operations are doing in plain language.
- Never force-push, reset --hard, or do destructive git operations without explicit confirmation.

## Conventions

- When the user dictates instructions, interpret them generously - they are communicating verbally.
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are ambiguous.
- Keep explanations simple and jargon-free.
